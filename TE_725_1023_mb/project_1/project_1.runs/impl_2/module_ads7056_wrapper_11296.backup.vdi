Resolution: Run report_timing_summary to analyze the hold violations.
WARNING: [Route 35-456] Router was unable to fix hold violation on 2 pins because of tight setup and hold constraints. Such pins are:
	module_ads7056_i/ADS7056_0/inst/data_reg[0]/CE
	module_ads7056_i/ADS7056_0/inst/data_reg[1]/CE

Resolution: Run report_timing_summary to analyze the hold violations.
WARNING: [Route 35-459] Router was unable to fix hold violation on 1 pins. This could be due to a combination of congestion, blockages and run-time limitations. Such pins are:
	module_ads7056_i/ADS7056_0/inst/data_reg[10]/CE

Resolution: You may try high effort hold fixing by turning on param route.enableGlobalHoldIter.
